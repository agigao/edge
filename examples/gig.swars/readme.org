* Swars: Star Wars API Browser

Well, this is a simple Clojurescript project, which fetches data from [[https://swapi.co][swapi.co]] and represents through data tables.

** Tools
- [[https://github.com/juxt/edge][Edge]] - a foundation for Clojure(script) web app by JUXT 
- [[https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent][Reagent]] - a simple, React Wrapper for Clojurescript
- [[https://bulma.io][Bulma]] - a CSS framework

That's all.

Have Fun,\\
